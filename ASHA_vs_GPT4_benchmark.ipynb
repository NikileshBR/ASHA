It's been a challenging journey, and it's commendable that you've tried various approaches like visualization, positive thinking, and medication to manage your symptoms. However, it's clear that these methods haven't been effective for you. It's essential to acknowledge that mental health issues can be complex and multifaceted, and what works for one person might not work for another. Today, we're going to approach this differently. We're going to identify a specific concern related to your mental health that you'd like to work on, and we'll break it down into manageable steps. We'll define the problem as a feeling of being overwhelmed by your thoughts and emotions, and we'll set realistic goals for managing this feeling. We'll explore the root causes of this confusion, such as past traumas, current stressors, and any underlying psychological conditions. We'll also examine your thought patterns and emotional responses to these triggers, and we'll develop strategies to challenge and reframe negative thoughts. This process is called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and it's designed to help you face your challenges more effectively by changing the way you think and feel about them. Let's begin by discussing the specific incidents or concerns that have been contributing to your feelings of confusion and chaos. We can explore these further and come up with strategies to help you manage them.\n",

Balancing caregiving responsibilities with personal relationships can be a delicate dance, and it's common to encounter resistance when setting boundaries. I want to help you explore strategies for communicating your needs more effectively and setting clearer boundaries. Additionally, I see that your anxiety levels are significantly impacting your ability to focus on self-care. We can work together to identify the root causes of your anxiety and develop a plan to manage it more effectively. Let's begin by exploring the specific challenges you've encountered when setting boundaries and communicating your needs. We'll also discuss potential strategies for managing your anxiety and prioritizing self-care in your life.\n",

You might consider setting specific times for responding to their requests or delegating tasks to others. It's also essential to remember that you're not alone in this situation and that seeking additional support, such as respite care or community resources, can be beneficial for both you and your mom.\n",
